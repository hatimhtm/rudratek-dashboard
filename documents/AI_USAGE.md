# AI Usage Disclosure

Per the assignment guidelines, this document outlines the usage of AI tools in the development of this project.

## Tools Used
- **Google Gemini / DeepMind Assistant:** Used for:
    - Scaffolding the initial project structure and configuration.
    - Generating realistic mock data (JSON) for projects.
    - Writing initial documentation (this file and README).
    - Debugging environment setup (Node.js installation).

## Specific Assistance
1.  **Mock Data Generation:** AI helped create a diverse dataset of 12 realistic projects with varying statuses, dates, and edge cases (long names) to test the UI.
2.  **CSS Utilities:** Assisted in suggesting Tailwind utility classes for complex layouts (e.g., the mobile-to-desktop grid transition).

## Ownership & Understanding
- I manually reviewed and refined all generated code.
- The architectural decisions (Client vs. Server components, URL-based state) were driven by software engineering best practices, not just AI suggestion.
- I fully understand every line of code in this repository and can explain the logic, trade-offs, and implementation details.
